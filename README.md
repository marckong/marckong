## About Me

Hi 👋 my name is Mark Minseok Kim. I am one of the builders at the Kong Insomnia team.

### Myers-Briggs Type
“The Campaigner” (ENFP-A)
Individual traits:
- Mind: 70% Extraverted
- Energy: 61% Intuitive
- Nature: 53% Feeling
- Tactics: 74% Prospecting
- Identity: 57% Assertive

Although it may not be completely accurate, I may have some attributes that belong to the ENFP-A type, but please don’t look at me with that filter. Having said that, if you would like to help me learn, I suggest you take the devil’s advocate approach instead of convincing why something is bad. If I can operate independently and explore, I may bring some good values to the table in collaboration.

### Working With Me
- I want to take my responsibility for my words how longever it takes
- I'm responsive and independent.
- I like to see what you are talking about to believe in it
- I would like to think through different scenarios
- I would appreciate direct and honest feedback rather than breadcrumbs
- When you give me feedback, please know that you are also welcome to ask for feedback as I believe in bidirectional feedback loops
- I believe that people have good intentions most of the time in their actions towards others unless proven otherwise with some signs.
- If we happen to be in the same city, I will invite you for homemade dinner when tools and space are available! Harissa chickpeas chicken or fusion dokkbokki is my default dish for that! (occasionally ramen).
- I will not ignore any of your comments in the PR and I will appreciate it if you leave comments instead of making “requested changes” unless it is actually breaking something.
- I believe that a group run by only one genius doesn’t go as far as a group made of few genius people who help others also turn into genius
- My principle to life is being flexible to changes
- I may not enjoy so much of very opinionated environments
- I love user experience! You can name it and we can discuss in length

### How I Perform
- I am a listener.
- I learn by thinking first and doing.
- I work well first on my own to organize my thinking and then collaborate to elevate the work and identify blind spots.
- I work well under stress, but my communication skills may regress.
- I work best in environments where exploration and flexibility are allowed.

### Coaching Me
- Allow me to reach out first for coaching unless there is a reason (for instance, I am experiencing some negativity -such as burnout- or creating some negativity)
- Challenge me gently by giving critical thinking; it works best when
- - you give me pros and cons without bias on one side
- - you ask me what’s my position and why?
- - you let me come back to you at it
- Utilize my strengths; avoid exposing my weaknesses.
- Let’s make action items out of the coaching
- If you need to criticize me, please do so gently and constructively with expected outcomes for changes.

### Final Thought

Let’s build some cool stuff together!
